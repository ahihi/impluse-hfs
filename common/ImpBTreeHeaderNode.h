///ImpBTreeHeaderNode inherits the map API from ImpBTreeMapNode since every header node contains a map record. Thus, the header node offers all the same methods for testing node allocations and allocating and deallocating nodes as a map node has. The difference is that a map node has only one record, which is a map record, whereas a header node has multiple records, of which the third is a map record.
